## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Performance goals not achievable
  - **Mitigation**: Early prototyping and benchmarking of critical components

- **Risk**: Rust learning curve impacts timeline
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate learning time, use experienced Rust developers as mentors

- **Risk**: Incompatibility with existing deployments
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure compatibility with existing configuration files and environments

### Project Risks
- **Risk**: Scope creep extends timeline
  - **Mitigation**: Clearly defined phases with explicit deliverables

- **Risk**: Resource constraints delay development
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize features, consider phased deployment of capabilities

## Success Criteria

The Rust rewrite will be considered successful if it achieves:

1. **Performance**: Meets or exceeds the performance targets in the analysis
2. **Functionality**: Provides all core features of the PHP version
3. **Usability**: Maintains or improves UX compared to PHP version
4. **Quality**: High test coverage and code quality
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for users and developers

## Post-Release Plan

After the initial release, the project will focus on:

1. **Community Feedback**: Gather and address feedback from users
2. **New Features**: Implement enhanced capabilities enabled by Rust
3. **Plugin System**: Develop an extensibility model for custom functionality
4. **Integration**: Create integration points with other systems
5. **Long-term Maintenance**: Establish sustainable maintenance practices
