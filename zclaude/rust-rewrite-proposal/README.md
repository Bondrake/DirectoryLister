# DirectoryLister Rust Rewrite Proposal

This repository contains a comprehensive proposal for rewriting the DirectoryLister project in Rust. The proposal focuses on leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features while maintaining the core functionality of the original PHP implementation.

## Documents

- [Proposal](./proposal.md) - Executive summary and high-level overview
- [Architecture](./architecture.md) - Detailed architecture design
- [Project Structure](./project-structure.md) - Directory and file organization
- [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md) - Expected performance improvements
- [Sample Code](./sample-code.md) - Example implementations of key components
- [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) - Development timeline and milestones
- [TODO](./TODO.md) - Actionable tasks to begin implementation

## Key Benefits

- **Performance**: Significant improvements in directory listing, search, and ZIP operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint for large directory operations
- **Concurrency**: Safe parallel processing of file operations
- **Safety**: Strong type system and memory safety guarantees
- **Modularity**: Clean, orthogonal architecture with clear boundaries
- **Extensibility**: Strong foundation for future features

## Getting Started

To start implementing this proposal:

1. Review the architecture document to understand the design principles
2. Examine the project structure to see how the code will be organized
3. Look at sample code examples to get a feel for the implementation approach
4. Follow the TODO list to begin development in a structured manner

## Comparison with PHP Version

The Rust rewrite maintains functional parity with the PHP version while addressing its limitations:

- Same core features (directory listing, search, ZIP generation)
- Similar configuration options and customization
- Compatible API for existing integrations
- Improved performance for large directories
- Enhanced concurrency for multiple simultaneous operations
- Better resource utilization on the server

## Next Steps

After reviewing this proposal, the next steps would be:

1. Approve the rewrite approach and architectural direction
2. Allocate resources according to the roadmap
3. Begin implementation following the TODO list
4. Set up continuous integration and testing infrastructure
5. Develop an incremental release strategy

## Contributing

This proposal is open for discussion and improvement. Feel free to suggest changes or enhancements to any aspect of the design or implementation plan.
